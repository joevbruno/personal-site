    "I am a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer who has spent the better part of the last half-decade leading teams and writing sophisticated, award winning UIs for non-profits, government contractors, and early stage startups with extensive experience utilizing Node, Typescript, React, and Redux in the Martech and Fintech business sectors. Iâ€™m always acquiring new skills and interests, and am currently pursuing additional certifications in the Offensive Security and InfoSec spaces. I currently hold the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.",
    "Beyond Full Stack Javascript and Offensive Security, I have predominantly worked with PHP, Wordpress, Laravel and occasionally, Ruby on Rails. To date, Iâ€™ve dabbled in Go, shipped an app or two in Elm and Elixir, and written enough Python to modify or create exploits and machine learning models. Iâ€™m comfortable on AWS and Cloudformation, can probably pwn your company's boxes, and thoroughly enjoy crafting elegant products from vision to delivery.",
    "Seeking a senior leadership position in engineering at a remote friendly, product-oriented company utilizing a Javascript heavy stack with a passion for security and design."
